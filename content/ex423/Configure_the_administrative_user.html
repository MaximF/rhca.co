This step too seems to fall under the setup script. On the step that asks **Set the Configuration Directory Server Administrator username** you just choose the default username, **admin** and setup a password.

	==============================================================================
	Please enter the administrator ID for the configuration directory
	server.  This is the ID typically used to log in to the console.  You
	will also be prompted for the password.

	Configuration directory server
	administrator ID [admin]: 
	Password: 
	Password (confirm): 

If I find anything else in the docs as I move along that may pertain to this, I'll add it, but for now it seems this is it.

An explanation of the setup prompts can be found here: [Explaination of setup promts](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Installation_Guide/Installation_Guide-Preparing_for_a_Directory_Server_Installation-Installation_Overview.html)
