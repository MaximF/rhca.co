title: Use TLS
objective: 9

Can we be more vague? Use TLS. So I'm guessing this means to secure both the directory server, as well as the admin, with certificates from our CA. That's what I'm running with. But who knows. 

If you look back on [Objective: Configure Red Hat Directory Server for TLS communication](http://rhca.co/ex423/Configure_Red_Hat_Directory_Server_for_TLS_communication.html) this was already kinda covered. So now all thats left is some client side connecting. 

I'm running my admin from my Fedora machine, where dirsrv is actually called 389-ds, so for me to open up the admin I just type:

	389-ds-console

And up pops my GUI. Right off the bat I have to enter in a password for my Directory Admin. This isnt secure however, as you can see in the url.

Now to setup a new cert for the Admin Console. 

(1) Log into the admin console. <br>
(2) Navigate to Administration Server in the tree to the left and open it (right click)<br>
(3) Choose "Manage Certificates" -> Request a new cert -> sign it -> install it. <br>
note: if you didn't read the other page on this, here it is: [http://rhca.co/ex423/Configure_Red_Hat_Directory_Server_for_TLS_communication.html](http://rhca.co/ex423/Configure_Red_Hat_Directory_Server_for_TLS_communication.html)<br>
(4) Add the CA Cert. <em>this is a different application, needs the ca cert as well</em><br>
(5) On the main Admin Server "Tasks" page, choose "Configure Admin Server" -> "encryption"<br>
(6) Check the box to enable SSL and Use RSA, as well as select your certificate, which should be the only option..<br>
(7) Close the admin, restart dirsrv-admin, and relaunch the admin (this time using https://)<br>

That's it, admin is setup for TLS as well. So now there does not exists a directory service that you cannot talk to with TLS, both admin and application are secured.
