title: Import user information from an LDIF file

To import ldif files, there are a few different routes that are listed in the [documentation](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Populating_Directory_Databases.html).

I'm going to list the first one, as I am guessing that is the one most commonly used. Links to the other sections exist below.

1. **1.** [*Import from the Directory Server Console.*](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Populating_Directory_Databases.html#Importing_Data-Importing_a_Database_from_the_Console) <br><br>
Use the Directory Server Console to append data to all of the databases, including database links. 
	
	When importing, the application is really just doing an ldapmodify to append, modify, or delete entries.
	*note as stated in the docs, that LDIF file must use UTF-8 encoding, as well as contain the root suffix*.<br><br>

	To open the management console, call the idm with the admin url as an arg:
		
		~# centos-idm-console -a http://admin.example.com:8084

	Up will pop a login screen for the GUI...

	Once logged in, the server will be displayed on the left hand side, and in the "Server Group" directory is the Administration Server link. Right click and open.  

	Next go to the "tasks" tab and click Import Databases.

	There is an option to select a LDIF file from the filesystem, and other options that are ok to leave default.

2. **2.** [*Initialize databases.*](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Populating_Directory_Databases.html#Importing_Data-Initializing_a_Database_from_the_Console) <br><br>
The Directory Server Console can import data to one database; this method overwrites any data contained by the database.



3. **3.** [*Importing data from the command-line.*](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Populating_Directory_Databases.html#Importing_Data-Importing_from_the_Command_Line) <br><br>
Directory Server provides command-line utilities to import data.
