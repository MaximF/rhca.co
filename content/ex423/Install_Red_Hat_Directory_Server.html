## Installing Red Hat Directory Server. ##
----

*To practice, I just fired up a VM at Amazon EC2 with Centos 5.8.*

Here are the steps I took to complete the first objective:

1) Install centos-ds. *Note:Directory Server 8.2 requires JRE version 1.6.0. This will be installed with the yum install*

	~]# yum install centos-ds

2) Run the setup script that walks us through the directory setup. Throw the -k to get the setup file.

    ~]# setup-ds-admin.pl -k

Then installer will ask a number of questions, most of which the defaults are fine. 

### Configure the Default LDAP Suffix
----
*Set the Directory Server suffix*

On the step that asks for your default suffix, you would enter that in. Easy. So for me, I used makewhatis.local as my domain, therefore mine was:
	
	dc=makewhatis,dc=local	

### Configure the administrative user
----
*Set the Configuration Directory Server Administrator username*

This is also in the setup script. As long this question is answered correctly during setup, and the password goes unforgotten, the objective is complete.


The setup script generates a log file in /tmp called setupXXXXX.log, which will contain all of the input you give throughout the script. 

For a full list of the questions for reference, here is a link to the redhat documentation regarding this setup:

[http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Installation_Guide/Installation_Guide-Preparing_for_a_Directory_Server_Installation-Installation_Overview.html](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Installation_Guide/Installation_Guide-Preparing_for_a_Directory_Server_Installation-Installation_Overview.html)

3) Tune and configure the system. 

*File Descriptors* - When the setup script ran, it may have spit out a bunch of warnings about your system

	Your system has been scanned for potential problems, missing patches,
	etc.  The following output is a report of the items found that need to
	be addressed before running this software in a production
	environment.

	CentOS Directory Server system tuning analysis version 10-AUGUST-2007.

	NOTICE : System is x86_64-unknown-linux2.6.18-xenU-ec2-v1.2 (1 processor).

	WARNING: 615MB of physical memory is available on the system. 1024MB is recommended for best performance on large production system.

	NOTICE : The net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time is set to 7200000 milliseconds
	(120 minutes).  This may cause temporary server congestion from lost
	client connections.

	WARNING: There are only 1024 file descriptors (hard limit) available, which
	limit the number of simultaneous connections.  

	WARNING: There are only 1024 file descriptors (soft limit) available, which
	limit the number of simultaneous connections.  

One of the warnings was for the file descriptor limit being set too low. The Installation Guide on the RedHat site walks us through setting the proper values. 

[http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html-single/Installation_Guide/index.html#Installation_Guide-Platform_Support-RHEL_Considerations](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html-single/Installation_Guide/index.html#Installation_Guide-Platform_Support-RHEL_Considerations-)

First see what the settings are set at by running a sysctl -a.

	~]# sysctl -a | grep file-max
	fs.file-max = 59512

Now in the /etc/sysctl.conf, add in the above max setting, but change it to the recommended number, 64000. 

	~]# echo "fs.file-max = 64000" >> /etc/sysctl.conf

The limits.conf file should also be altered in  /etc/security/limits.conf

	~]# vim  /etc/security/limits.conf
	// increase the number of allowed open files to 8192 by adding the following line. 
	*        -        nofile        8192

It also advises that we exit the system-auth file, for Pam Limits. 

	~]# vim /etc/pam.d/system-auth
	// add in the following
	session 	required 	/lib/security/$ISA/pam_limits.so

Then reboot the system to make sure that all the changes are applied before moving on. Now the Directory Server should be installed. 

One last thing, make sure the services are set to run at boot. 

	~]# chkconfig dirsrv on
	~]# chkconfig dirsrv-admin on
	~]# chkconfig --list | grep dir
	dirsrv         	0:off	1:off	2:on	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
	dirsrv-admin   	0:off	1:off	2:on	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off

## Configure a Slave Replica
----
Ok, so I did this step a ways after I initially setup my directory server. I include kerberos and the whole deal. When I gathered the list of requirements, I ignored the hierarchy of the objectives and just guessed that the slave replica would use Kerberos as well. So here it is. If I tear this whole thing down and realize 

[Replication Chapter](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Managing_Replication.html)

Replication is the process by which directory data/entries are copied to other directory servers that respond to requests for the same domain. Smallest unit that can be replicated is a database. 

[A good reference to rhds databases](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Configuring_Directory_Databases-Creating_and_Maintaining_Databases.html)

The objective is to configure a slave replica, which in its most simple form is a copy of the master that we can read and write to. I found [Configuring Single-Master Replication](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Managing_Replication-Configuring_Single_Master_Replication.html) that has a full guide on getting this setup.

### Install DS on the new box and configure it.
----
On a brand new box, another libvirt machine for me, install the appropriate packages.

    yum install -y centos-ds

Initially I didnt do the correct thing on my master server setup, and pump out the setup file during setup. The -k flag does that, and makes it really nice when setting up slaves. If you have that file, you can transfer it to the new box and run:
    
    setup-ds-admin.pl --file=/tmp/setup.inf --silent

If not, then run the setup again, maybe pump out a setup file this time ;-)
    
    setup-ds-admin.pl -k

I followed the same steps that I did for the master
 
* Generating cert request and signing with ca, installed it, and configured TLS
* Adding the password in the password file for startup
* Ran chkconfig to configure boot time start.

### Add Kerberos configuration
----
[Fedoras Documentation](http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Howto:Kerberos) was a great help here for setting up Kerberos.

Kerberos packages need to be installed. 

    yum install krb5-workstation

I copied over my `/etc/krb5.conf` from the master, made sure NTP was running, and time was correct.

Then ran the following to configure the slave host as a principal.
    
    kadmin -p root/admin -q "add_principal -randkey ldap/dc04.makewhatis.local"
    kadmin -p root/admin -q "ktadd -k /etc/dirsrv/ds.keytab ldap/dc04.makewhatis.local"

    chown ldap:ldap /etc/dirsrv/ds.keytab
    chmod 600 /etc/dirsrv/ds.keytab

    echo "KRB5_KTNAME=/etc/dirsrv/ds.keytab ; export KRB5_KTNAME" >> /etc/sysconfig/dirsrv

### Configure the Master for replication
----
The instructions that Redhat gives are pretty on point. I followed them to configure the master for replication without having to change anything.

### Configure the consumer (slave)
----
Main thing I had to make sure of is creating a replication user to bind to. Pretty much just involves creating a user `cn=Replication Manager,cn=config` in the gui. 

On the slave, right click on config -> new user -> Replication Manager w/ password

[Details here](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Creating_the_Supplier_Bind_DN_Entry.html)

### Create the replication agreement
----
This part was pretty straightforward as well. From the configuration tab on the ds-console on master, right click on userRoot under replication. Add the server:port and choose encryption method. Start TLS is what I did with Simple as bind method. 

Enter in Replication Manager bind dn and follow the rest of the defaults. At the end choose to always keep in sync/initialize now and you should have replication within a minute or so. 

### Test it out. 
----
I played around and added entries in master, and then did a search against my slave. 

### Configure Client Machine
----
In order to have my client try both servers, in case one is down, there needs to be an entry in `/etc/openldap/ldap.conf`. All that needs to be done is to add the other host to the URL entry.

    URI ldap://dc01.makewhatis.local/ ldap://dc04.makewhatis.local/
