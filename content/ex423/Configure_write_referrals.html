Configure replication (single master)
-------------------------------------

[http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Managing_Replication-Configuring_Single_Master_Replication.html#step-supplierDN-single](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Administration_Guide/Managing_Replication-Configuring_Single_Master_Replication.html#step-supplierDN-single)

## on the consumer ##


(1) stop the dirsrv, back dse.ldif, and add this entry:

    dn: cn=replication manager,cn=config
    objectClass: inetorgperson
    objectClass: person
    objectClass: top
    objectClass: organizationalPerson
    cn: replication manager
    sn: RM
    userPassword: password
    passwordExpirationTime: 20380119031407Z

*dont worry about the password, we can change that in the directory.*

(2) start the dirsrv back up, navigate to the above entry and change that password so that its encrypted in the ldif file. 

(3) in the configuration -> Replication tab choose userRoot from the left tree. 
    - enable replica
    - Dedicated Consumer
    - add new Supplier DN - cn=replication manager,cn=config

*this is the dn that we added above, the one that supplier uses to connect and push updates*

## on the supplier ##

(1) enable changelog in replication settings. 

**console -> configuration -> Replication -> supplier settings**

(2) choose userRoot in the tree in the replication section, and enable replica, as single master.

(3) right click on userRoot, select "New Replication Agreement" 
    - add consumer hostname:389 (port is only used for identification in panel.)
    - Use StartTLS
    - Simple
        * Bind as: cn=replication manager,cn=config
        * Password: enter the one you made above
    Choose defaults for everything except the last step. *Initialize Consumer Now* would be what we choose

## Testing ##

Possible errors:

* upon choosing "done" in the replication agreement this error pops up:
    - The consumer initialization has unsuccessfully completed. The error received byt the replica is: '3 Replication error aquiring replica: permission denied'

- This means that you may be a bit sleep deprived like I was, and tried to setup the "Current Supplier DNs" as cn=directory manager,cn=config instead of replication manager. If the slave is only allowing replication manager to connect for updates, and directory manager tries to, well hes gonna get kicked out.

At this point get onto the master and add an entry. Does it show up in the consumer?
