###  Setup NIS Server

For this I setup 2 servers, a NIS server, and a NIS client. I just spun these up on EC2 for a few hours to get this all working, so that I can replicate the task. For myself, I have never really messed with NIS, apart from what I learned studying for the first exams. 

Ill go over my NIS setup first. Since that was new, I just wrote it all down as well..

My Two hosts were:

* nis.makewhatis.com
* nis-client.makewhatis.com

I used this guide to set it up, changing the info for myself. [http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_5&p=nis](http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_5&p=nis)

*** Also notice that throughout this I use the private IPS for my EC2 instances. For some reason NIS didn't want to work with my elastic ips. So use the private ips. Just keep in mind that these get reset each time you destroy and rebuild your environment. ***

#### Starting with with server

    [root@nis ~]# yum -y install ypserv
    [root@nis ~]# ypdomainname nis.makewhatis.com
    [root@nis ~]# vim /etc/sysconfig/network
    NETWORKING=yes
    NETWORKING_IPV6=no
    HOSTNAME=nis.makewhatis.com
    NISDOMAIN=nis.makewhatis.com

    [root@nis ~]# vim /var/yp/Makefile
    # MERGE_PASSWD=true|false
    # line 42: change
    MERGE_PASSWD=false
    # MERGE_GROUP=true|false
    # line 46: change
    MERGE_GROUP=false
    # line 117: add if not already there.
    all: passwd shadow group hosts rpc services netid protocols

    [root@nis ~]# vim /var/yp/securenets
     255.255.255.0   10.0.0.0

    [root@nis ~]# vim /etc/hosts
    # add own IP address
    10.172.9.100      nis.makewhatis.com nis

    [root@nis ~]# /sbin/service portmap start 
    Starting portmap: [ OK ]
    [root@nis ~]# /sbin/service ypserv start 
    Starting YP server services: [  OK  ]
    [root@nis ~]# /etc/init.d/yppasswdd start 
    Starting YP passwd service: [  OK  ]
    [root@nis ~]# chkconfig portmap on 
    [root@nis ~]# chkconfig ypserv on 
    [root@nis ~]# chkconfig yppasswdd on
    [root@nis ~]# /usr/lib64/yp/ypinit -m # update NIS database
    At this point, we have to construct a list of the hosts which will run NIS
    servers. dir.server.world is in the list of NIS server hosts. Please continue to add
    the names for the other hosts, one per line. When you are done with the
    list, type a <control D>.
    next host to add: nis.makewhatis.com
    next host to add:# push Ctrl + D key
    The current list of NIS servers looks like this:

    nis.makewhatis.com

    Is this correct?  [y/n: y]  y
    We need a few minutes to build the databases...
    Building /var/yp/nis.makewhatis.com/ypservers...
    Running /var/yp/Makefile...
    gmake[1]: Entering directory `/var/yp/nis.makewhatis.com'
    Updating passwd.byname...
    Updating passwd.byuid...
    Updating group.byname...
    Updating group.bygid...
    Updating hosts.byname...
    Updating hosts.byaddr...
    Updating rpc.byname...
    Updating rpc.bynumber...
    Updating services.byname...
    Updating services.byservicename...
    Updating netid.byname...
    Updating protocols.bynumber...
    Updating protocols.byname...
    Updating mail.aliases...
    gmake[1]: Leaving directory `/var/yp/nis.makewhatis.com'

    nis.makewhatis.com has been set up as a NIS master server.

    Now you can run ypinit -s nis.makewhatis.com on all slave server.

    # It's neccessary to update NIS database with following way if new user is added again
    [root@nis ~]# cd /var/yp 
    [root@dir yp]# make 

For this to work on EC2 with my firewalls, I had to bind the service to a specific port. On the server this part was a bit more straighforward than the client, as the config was set in sysconfig.

    [root@nis yp]# vim /etc/sysconfig/network
    #added 
    YPSERV_ARGS="--port 647"

### Setting up the client. 

Again I just used steps found on the same site, targeted for client setup. [http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_5&p=nis&f=2](http://www.server-world.info/en/note?os=CentOS_5&p=nis&f=2)

    [root@nis-client ~]# yum -y install ypbind
    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/sysconfig/network
    NETWORKING=yes
    NETWORKING_IPV6=no
    HOSTNAME=nis-client.makewhatis.com
    # add at the last line
    NISDOMAIN=nis.makewhatis.com

    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/sysconfig/authconfig
    USENIS=yes# line 19: change

    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/yp.conf
    # dd at the last line ( [domain] server [NIS server] )
    domain nis.makewhatis.com server nis.makewhatis.com

    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/nsswitch.conf
    passwd:files nis# line 33: add
    shadow:files nis# add
    group:files nis# add
    hosts:files dns nis# add
    # add optionally if you need ( create home directory automatically if it's none )

    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/pam.d/system-auth
    # add at the last line
    session     optional      pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel umask=077 


I had to bind this service to a specific port inside of the init script, since I am using EC2 and only want one port open. I chose 647, like the server. 

    [root@nis-client ~]# vim /etc/init.d/ypbind
    #added -p 647 in OPTS
    OTHER_YPBIND_OPTS="-p 647"
    [root@nis-client ~]# service ypbind restart
    [root@nis-client ~]# rpcinfo -p
    program vers proto   port
    100000    2   tcp    111  portmapper
    100000    2   udp    111  portmapper
    100007    2   udp    647  ypbind
    100007    1   udp    647  ypbind
    100007    2   tcp    647  ypbind
    100007    1   tcp    647  ypbind

    [root@nis-client ~]# chkconfig portmap on 
    [root@nis-client ~]# chkconfig ypbind on 
    [root@nis-client ~]# shutdown -r now

Upon reboot of your server, you should be able to log in as a user from the nis server to the client. 

    nis-client.makewhatis.com login: david# user on NIS
    Password:# password
    Creating directory '/home/david'.

    [david@nis-client ~]$ ypwhich 
    nis.makewhatis.com

    [david@nis-client ~]$ ypcat passwd
    david:x:502:502::/home/david:/bin/bash
    ec2-user:x:500:500::/home/ec2-user:/bin/bash

    [david@nis-client ~]$ ypcat hosts
    10.172.9.111    nis.makewhatis.com nis
    127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost
    127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain localhost
    10.172.9.111     nis.makewhatis.com nis

We can even change the password of our user from NIS, on the client. 

    [david@nis-client ~]$ yppasswd
    Changing NIS account information for david on nis.makewhatis.com.
    Please enter old password:
    Changing NIS password for david on nis.makewhatis.com.
    Please enter new password:
    Please retype new password:

    The NIS password has been changed on nis.makewhatis.com.

    [david@nis-client ~]$ exit


### Install openldap clients on the main RHDS

`openldap-clients` will have to be installed if you want to use the openldap cli tools. 

    [root@dc03 ~]# yum install -y openldap-clients

### Using migration scripts on the Directory Server

I used the following documentation to study for this part, [http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/s2-ldap-migrate.html](http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/5/html/Deployment_Guide/s2-ldap-migrate.html), which actually just pointed me to `/usr/share/openldap/migration/`. This directory is part of the `openldap-servers` package, so without that package installed, you will not see it. Rather than install the package, I just downloaded the scripts themselves from their source, [http://www.padl.com/download/MigrationTools.tgz](http://www.padl.com/download/MigrationTools.tgz).

    wget -O /usr/share/openldap/migration.tgz http://www.padl.com/download/MigrationTools.tgz
    cd /usr/share/openldap/ ; tar xvzf migration.tgz

I started by editing the `migrate_common.ph` to contain my info in the variables, starting at line 70. Notice they give an option to use EXTENDED_SCHEMA. This is because the default schema would enter our users in using the account objectclass, whereas you would probably want to use the inetOrgPerson instead if you are storing more than just login info. Check out the two schemas and you will see the difference.

    # Default DNS domain
    $DEFAULT_MAIL_DOMAIN = "makewhatis.com";

    # Default base 
    $DEFAULT_BASE = "dc=makewhatis,dc=com";

    # Turn this on for inetLocalMailReceipient
    # sendmail support; add the following to 
    # sendmail.mc (thanks to Petr@Kristof.CZ):
    ##### CUT HERE #####
    #define(`confLDAP_DEFAULT_SPEC',`-h "ldap.padl.com"')dnl
    #LDAPROUTE_DOMAIN_FILE(`/etc/mail/ldapdomains')dnl
    #FEATURE(ldap_routing)dnl
    ##### CUT HERE #####
    # where /etc/mail/ldapdomains contains names of ldap_routed
    # domains (similiar to MASQUERADE_DOMAIN_FILE).
    $DEFAULT_MAIL_HOST = "mail.makewhatis.com";

    # turn this on to support more general object clases
    # such as person.
    $EXTENDED_SCHEMA = 1;


There are different scripts for different files, formats, and services that reside on your linux system. I pulled in the breakdown from [http://www.padl.com/OSS/MigrationTools.html](http://www.padl.com/OSS/MigrationTools.html)

**migrate_base.pl** creates naming context entries, including subordinate contexts such as ou=people and ou=devices.<br>
**migrate_aliases.pl** migrates aliases in /etc/aliases to entries conforming to the rfc822MailGroup schema. Organizations who have deployed LDAP-based messaging solutions, such as Netscape's Messaging Server, may wish to use a different schema for representing mail aliases. Ypldapd does not use X.500 groups (such as groupOfUniqueNames) for mail alias expansion because flattening an arbitrarily nested group at runtime may be expensive. (It is possible to write a ypldapd plug-in to support such a schema, however.)<br>
**migrate_group.pl** migrates groups in /etc/group<br>
**migrate_hosts.pl** migrates hosts in /etc/hosts<br>
**migrate_networks.pl** migrates networks in /etc/networks<br>
**migrate_passwd.pl** migrates users in /etc/passwd. Note that if users are allowed read the userPassword attribute, and your LDAP server doesn't support authenticating against hashed passwords then anyone may read the userPassword attribute's value and authenticate as that user. Modern LDAP servers, such as Netscape Directory Server, support authenticating against hashed passwords, so this is not an issue. The OpenLDAP LDAP server also supports such authentication.<br>
**migrate_protocols.pl** migrates protocols in /etc/protocols<br>
**migrate_services.pl** migrates services in /etc/services<br>
**migrate_netgroup.pl** migrates netgroups in /etc/netgroup<br>
**migrate_netgroup_byuser.pl** migrates the netgroup.byuser map. It requires revnetgroup.<br>
**migrate_netgroup_byhost.pl** migrates the netgroup.byhost map. It requires revnetgroup.<br>
**migrate_rpc.pl** migrates RPCs in /etc/rpc<br>


### Exporting my NIS users and groups

On the NIS server I used the scripts to dump my NIS info into ldif files:

    [root@nis ~]# mkdir `date +%Y%m%d`
    [root@nis ~]# cd /usr/share/openldap/
    [root@nis migration]# ./migrate_base.pl > ~/`date +%Y%m%d`/base-schema.ldif
    [root@nis migration]# ./migrate_passwd.pl /etc/passwd ~/`date +%Y%m%d`/passwd-data.ldif       
    [root@nis migration]# ./migrate_group.pl /etc/group ~/`date +%Y%m%d`/groups-data.ldif

Then to get auto.home for home directory mapping, if it exists. I didnt have this on mine, but since it was in the guide I figured I would just add it just for good measure.

    cat auto.home | grep -v ^#  | grep ^[0-9A-Za-z] | sort > /tmp/`date +%Y%m$d`/auto.home

Copy files to Directory Server.

### Importing the ldif files created on the NIS server to RHDS.

Now to add the entries that were exported from NIS, which we can do with the openldap ldapadd command. ldapadd, if you check out the man page, is just a link to ldapmodify w/ the -a flag implied. There are quite a few options for ldapadd, and we are going to use a handful of them. 

**-Z**: I use the -Z (not -ZZ because the operation may have errors, which are common when importing).<br>
**-x**: use simple auth instead of SASL<br>
**-W**: Prompt for password<br>
**-c**: Continue even on error, reporting errors but not stopping the entire operation<br>
**-v**: Verbose<br>
**-D**: Specify the directory manager, which is implied, but I throw it in there for good habit.<br>

First I'll import the base.ldif that I first generated.

    [root@dc03 ~]# ldapadd -Z -x -W -c -v -D "cn=Directory Manager" -f ~/base-schema.ldif
    
Next I'll add the passwd export with the same options. And following that the groups. (I pruned the passwd.ldif after generating it, to only include our users, the other files I left untouched.)
    
    [root@dc03 ~]# ldapadd -Z -x -W -c -v -D "cn=Directory Manager" -f ~/passwd-data.ldif
    [root@dc03 ~]# ldapadd -Z -x -W -c -v -D "cn=Directory Manager" -f ~/group-data.ldif

### Double check the acls making sure everyone cannot read password.

Main thing that needs to be done is to make sure other users cant just view password and shadow info. To do this we can just edit the ACLs in the nifty editor RHDS gives. If you dont do this, well then people could just query the ldap server and get the hashes, no good. This happend to me by default, but I read the actually step on a number of sites, so I figure its best to just get in the habit of doing it. Here is the link to a guide that breaks that down.

* [http://mwiki.yyovkov.net/index.php/Install_LDAP_port_389_on_CentOS#Adding_ACLs](http://mwiki.yyovkov.net/index.php/Install_LDAP_port_389_on_CentOS#Adding_ACLs)

### Make authentication work on clients

*On Client01:*

Last part of this migration is actually getting client servers to authenticate via the new entries of the directory. 

For this part I am referring to the 389 directory server wiki: [http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Howto:PAM](http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Howto:PAM)

Make sure nss_ldap and nscd are both installed, otherwise this will not work.

    [root@dc03 ~]# yum install nss_ldap nscd 

We can actually handle this all in a one-liner, which I like. 

    authconfig --enableldap --enableldapauth --enablecache --disablenis  \
          --ldapserver=dc03.makewhatis.com --ldapbasedn=dc=makewhatis,dc=com \
          --updateall

_From the authconfig man page:_

    The --enablenis, --enableldap, --enablewinbind, and --enablehesiod options are used to configure user
    information services in /etc/nsswitch.conf, the --enablecache option is used to configure naming
    services caching, and the --enableshadow, --enableldapauth, --enablekrb5, and --enablewinbindauth 
    options are used to configure authentication functions via /etc/pam.d/system-auth. Each --enable has a matching --disable option that disables the service if it is already enabled. The respective services have parameters which configure their server names etc.

`authconfig` takes care of updating files `/etc/nsswitch.conf`, `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`, etc. for us. One extra thing that you will run into when not using automounts of home directories is, home dirs not being autocreated.

Put this line before the rest of the "session" entries in `/etc/pam.d/system-auth`:

    session     required      pam_mkhomedir.so skel=/etc/skel umask=0022

Now having configured everything correctly, you can log in as one of your NIS users to client01.
