Centos 5.8 (vms in kvm) on 192.168.1.0/24
-----------------------

* **Clients**
    - client01.makewhatis.local
    - client02.makewhatis.local
    - client03.makewhatis.local
    - client04.makewhatis.local
* **KDC**
    - kerberos.makewhatis.local
* **RHDS Servers. Master and Slave**
    - dc01.makewhatis.local
    - dc04.makewhatis.local
* **NIS client/server pair**
    - nis-client.makewhatis.local
    - nis.makewhatis.local
* **CA signing server**
    - ca.makewhatis.local
    *Need to have a CA server, RHDS will not run without a signed certificate*
* **DNS nameserver**
    - ns01.makewhatis.local
    *Internal dns uses bind and all hosts have proper RDNS. (RDNS is needed for kerberos, its picky)*


## My Excercises

### Prep

* **Prepare the environment**
    - **Setup servers with hostnames and setup new zone file for acme.local**
        * dc01.acme.local     192.168.1.200
        * dc02.acme.local     192.168.1.201
        * client.acme.local   192.168.1.202
        * nis.acme.local      192.168.1.203
    - **Make sure all servers are configured to resolve dns from 192.168.1.132**
    - **NIS server should have NIS setup, and the following users on it**
        * jon, tom, bill, jim, alan, christy
    - **Setup kerberos domain ACME.LOCAL**
        * should have admin user as well as the above users

### Go time steps

* **Install rhds on dc01.acme.local for ACME.LOCAL**
    - Configure LDAP suffix for ACME.LOCAL
    - Admin should have a password of acme123
* **Configure a slave, dc02.acme.local**
    - slave should replicate in real time.
    - slave should refer any writes to master.
* **Setup all Directory Services DS/DS-admin to communicate via TLS**
    - request certificates
    - install certificates
    - configure ca certs
    - slave should talk via TLS
    - console talk via TLS
    - setup command line tools to query a dc=acme,dc=local with TLS
* **Import all NIS users from nis.acme.local to dc01**
    - Users should retain their shadow info.
    - Groups should be migrated as well.
* **Restrict normal users from seeing email attribuite**
    - command: `ldapsearch -x -s sub -b "dc=makewhatis,dc=local" "cn=ice" mail` should NOT return the mail attribute.
    - user should still be able to view 
* **Configure authentication with Kerberos/LDAP**
    - client01 should be able to authenticate via kerberos. 

* ***TODO***
    - Create/Modify inetOrgPerson entries
    - Import LDIF
    - Export LDIF
    - Active Directory
