title: Configure the default LDAP suffix

This almost seems like a trick objective. But this is done during the setup process of the Directory Server. 

The step that does this is **Set the Directory Server suffix** and this defaults to example.com. Only thing I could imagine having to do different would be to set a custom suffix on this step. 

	==============================================================================
	The suffix is the root of your directory tree.  The suffix must be a valid DN.
	It is recommended that you use the dc=domaincomponent suffix convention.
	For example, if your domain is example.com,
	you should use dc=example,dc=com for your suffix.
	Setup will create this initial suffix for you,
	but you may have more than one suffix.
	Use the directory server utilities to create additional suffixes.

	Suffix [dc=example, dc=com]:
