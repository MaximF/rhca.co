This is a log of my studies for the expert exams that make up the RHCA. So far I am not taking the classes, just going off of the objectives given by Red Hat, and using their technical manuals to practice.

I am splitting the site into sections based on the exams, and then each section will contain the official objectives given by Red Hat. 

[Red Hat Enterprise Directory Services and Authentication Expertise Exam (EX423)](/ex423)

*Performance-based expertise exam that tests the knowledge and skill regarding enterprise directory services and authentication.*

*I am in no way, shape, or form affiliated with Red Hat Inc. Just a guy trying to study for these crazy exams, and wanting to log it online*
